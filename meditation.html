            <h3>Mindfulness meditation </h3>
            <p>
                Mindfulness meditation originates from Buddhist teachings and is the most
popular and researched form of meditation in the West.

In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass
through your mind. You don’ t judge the thoughts or become involved with
them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.

This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful
to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations,
thoughts, or feelings.

This type of meditation is good for people who don’ t have a teacher to guide
them, as it can be easily practiced alone.

            <h3>2. Spiritual meditation </h3>
            <p>
                Spiritual meditation is used in nearly all religions and spiritual traditions.

The types of spiritual meditation are as diverse as the world’s spiritual
traditions themselves. Many of the meditation techniques listed in this article
could be considered spiritual meditation.

According to a 2017 study Trusted Source, spiritual meditation focuses on
developing a deeper understanding of spiritual/religious meaning and
connection with a higher power. Examples include:

Christian contemplative prayer

Sufi dhikr (remembrance of God)
Jewish kabbalistic practices

Spiritual meditation can be practiced at home or in a place of worship. This
practice is beneficial for those who seek spiritual growth and a deeper
connection to a higher power or spiritual force.

            <h3>3.Focused meditation </h3>
            <p>
                Focused meditation involves concentration using any of the five senses.

For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can
bring in external influences to help focus your attention.

Examples include:

counting mala beads
listening to a gong
staring at a candle flame
counting your breaths
moon gazing

This practice may be simple in theory, but it can be difficult for beginners to
hold their focus for longer than a few minutes at first.

If your mind does wander, simply come back to the practice and refocus.

As the name suggests, this practice is ideal for anyone who wants to sharpen
their focus and attention.

            <h3>4. Movement meditation </h3>
            <p>
                Although most people think of yoga when they hear movement meditation, this
practice may include:

walking
gardening
qi gong
tai chi

other gentle forms of movement

This is an active form of meditation where the movement guides you into a
deeper connection with your body and the present moment.

Movement meditation is good for people who find peace in action and want to
develop body awareness.

            <h3>5. Mantra meditation </h3>
            <p>
                Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and
Buddhist traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the
mind. It can be a word, phrase, or sound, one of the most common being “om.”

Your mantra can be spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for
some time, you’ll be more alert and in tune with your environment. This allows
you to experience deeper levels of awareness.

Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a
word than on their breath. Others enjoy feeling the vibration of the sound in their
body.

This is also a good practice for people who don’t like silence and enjoy
repetition.

            <p>
                Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a type of meditation that’s been the subject
of numerous studies in the scientific community.

TM was founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and refers to a specific practice
designed to quiet the mind and induce a state of calm and peace. It involves
the use of mantra and is best taught by a certified TM practitioner.

            <h3>7. Progressive relaxation </h3>
            <p>
                Also known as body scan meditation, progressive relaxation is a practice aimed
at reducing tension in the body and promoting relaxation.

Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly tightening and relaxing one
muscle group at a time throughout the body.

In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle wave flowing
through your body to help release any tension.

This form of meditation is often used to relieve stress and unwind before
bedtime.

            <h3>8. Loving-kindness meditation </h3>
            <p>
                Loving-kindness meditation is used to strengthen feelings of compassion,
kindness, and acceptance toward oneself and others.

It typically involves opening the mind to receive love from others and then
sending well wishes to love ones, friends, acquaintances, and all living beings.

Because this type of meditation is intended to promote compassion and
kindness, it may be ideal for those holding feelings of anger or resentment.

            <h3>9. Visualization meditation </h3>
            <p>
                Visualization meditation is a technique focused on enhancing feelings of
relaxation, peace, and calmness by visualizing positive scenes, images, or
figures.

This practice involves imagining a scene vividly and using all five senses to add
as much detail as possible. It can also involve holding a beloved or honored
figure in mind with the intention of embodying their qualities.

Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself
succeeding at specific goals, which is intended to increase focus and
motivation.

Many people use visualization meditation to boost their mood, reduce stress
levels, and promote inner peace.
